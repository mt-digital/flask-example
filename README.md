# example-http-request

This repository contains examples of HTTP requests using jQuery on the frontend and a Flask server on the backend.

The GET request is straightforward. 

If you organize your windows properly you can see the POST request writing to the web console 
on the frontend and terminal console on the backend, like as shown in the screenshot below:

Check [static/js/example.js](/static/js/example.js) 
to see how the frontend code sends the request to the backend, and how the backend handles the request
in [app.py](/app.py).
